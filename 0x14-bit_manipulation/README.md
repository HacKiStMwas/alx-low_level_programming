/*This Project has 7 Tasks as follows, Write:

Task Zero: a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

Task One: a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

Task Two: a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

Task Three: a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

Task Four: a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

Task Five: a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

Task Six: a function that checks the endianness.
